/*
You are working on a web page and have the following task to do in javascript.

The web page is displaying the results of a search. 
Sample search results is <li>red</li><li>green</li><li>blue</li>.

Your job is to enclose the search results in open and close tags for an unordered list. 
If there are no results, then display an H2 that says 'No Results.'

You may not use an if statement or a ternary operator; you can only perform variable assignments. 
You must also work with the following variables: openlist, closelist, searchresults, e

The final result of your code (either a list or an h2) has to be stored in the e variable,
and the open and close tags have to be in the openlist and closelist variables, respectively.

Write the code for both cases when there are and are not any search results. 
Output the value of e at the end of each case.
