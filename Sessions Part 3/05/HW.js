/*
Write a function called xcrypt that takes a phrase and can either encrypt or decrypt it.
The encryption method is to change each character in the phrase to the next specified number of characters in the ascii chart.
For example if the prhase it "hello world" and the user specifies 5 then the result would be "jgnnq"yqtnf"
because j has the ascii value of h + 2, and so on for the rest of the chars.
You should be able to call the function like this: let x = xcrypt("hello world",2) to encrypt and xcrypt(x,-2) to decrypt
