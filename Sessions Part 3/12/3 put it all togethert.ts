You are writing softare to transmit data over a network that has the following rules:
a) First trasmit the number of chars in the string to be transmitted followed by :
b) The data has to be sent in packets of no more than 3 chars at a time. Each char should be separated by a -
c) After every packet transmit ---
d) when finished transmit :end
d) Beware of undefined, null, and NaN that may be passed to your system for transmitting. If you receive that then transmit "INVALID".

Write a JS function that take a string and transmits the data following the specified rules.
In place of sending the data on the network console.log it.
