## Welcome to CPU Code School Solo Course!
#### Following are some instructions:
-  This is a GitHub Repository which contains all the information you'll need for the course. 
-  In this repo you'll submit all your classwork and homework for review and marking.
-  Mentors are available for assistance and troubleshooting, all you need to do is reach out to them. 
-  There are two methods for getting direct help. Slack and Stackoverflow. In  addition, you can always pose questions in the HW and a mentor will respond in the HW file.       Please do not hesitate to reach out, as we want you to succeed in your journey to become a proficient software developer.
-  All course work will be done on your computer, and then committed to this repo. Remember to watch the Video on HW Submission because it is a multi-step process and can be confusing in the beginning.
-  Remember to always follow along during the Video and keep up with typing the code, so you'll be able to do the HW smoothly. 
-  Always complete all session work and HW before  proceeding to the next session, as all the work is cumulative and requires understanding concepts taught in earlier sessions.
#### Good Luck!!!
